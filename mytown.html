          <h1>My Town</h1>
          <p>This section is all about Guatemala the place I grew up on. </p>
          <p> Guatemala is a beautiful place filled with spectalucar views and a lot of nature.
            Some of my best memories of all time are there. Being on the beach
            with my family, swimming, running on the sand, catching and eating fishes
            it was just the best.
          </p>

          <p>I loved being in Guatemala, I felt just so free there, spending
            time with my grandparents over there was my favorite part and I hope 
          to be able to go back another time to just relax. </p>
          <img src="./images/quetzal.webp" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;">
          <p> Now that I am living here in the United States I miss Guatemala a lot,
            I don't know my way around here very well and having to adapt and adjust to 
          english was very difficult but i was able to do it, its not bad living here 
        and there are more opportunities to be succesful in life here in America
      but it just don't come close to my life in Guatemala.  </p>
